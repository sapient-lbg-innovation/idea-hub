# Idea Hub

Idea hub is an open innovation and collaboration platform. We encourage everyone to help share ideas which can change the way we all work and look into problems around us.

Successfully innovating has become a matter of organizational agility. Delivering sustainable innovation requires developing appropriate responses to changing consumer, market and tehcnological requirements whilst providing meaningful added value over competitive offerings. This mandates installing holistic, yet diligently executed management processes across each component of the innovation life-cycle: from the collection of ideas to project implementation and a follow-up based on demand.

# What is Idea hub and how it works

Idea hub is all about facilitated structured, collaborative, global ideation.

* The goal is to engaged and build an efficient ideation community which co-creates high quality ideas whilst remaining fully connected through collaborative social features.
* Drastically accelerate the review and decision process by funneling ideas through a workflow reflecting our business strategy and evaluation criteria, progressing only with the most relevant and promising ideas.
* Engage with innovation guild, external experts  and consumers to further enrich the outcome of the ideation cycle.

# Engagement with our teams

Idea hub is all about enabling engineering community to creatively think on core business challenges.

* It will allow the launch of engaging, time-bound challenges to streamline the ideation energy with the specific business needs.
* Provide control with autonomy and visibility over each ideation challenge through customizing the ideation workflow and evaluation criteria.
* Boost participation rate and contribution levels within the community through embedded gamification techniques and rewards allocation features along with ability to track and measure.

# Ideation Workflow

1. Capturing and categorising the idea:
   * We will use [Github issues](https://github.com/sapient-lbg-innovation/idea-hub/issues) against Idea Hub repository to capture ideas.
   * Ideas are categorised into four:
      * **Gig:** Have an Idea, request teams/engineers to help come-up with a spike
      * **Incremental innovation:** are new ideas but do not require significant changes to how an organisation operates
      * **Semi-Radical Innovation:** A new idea that requires a change in how an organisation operates (its business model),             processes, services or products.
      * **Radical Innovation:** Entirely changes how an organisation operates as it requires new knowledge and skills and               renders current products, services, processes etc obsolete

2. Guild review and decision process (WIP)
3. Engagement from community and funding (WIP)
4. Recognition and Reward framework (WIP)
